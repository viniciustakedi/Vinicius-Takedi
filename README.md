## Hi, I'm Vinicius Takedi :wave:

### Some projects:

| My Website  |  Currency Converter BR  |
| ------------------- | ------------------- |
| It's a presentation about me with contacts, skills and stuff. The link works normally. |  It is a currency converter, the API used is that of the European central bank. Sometimes the site takes a long time to load because of the server. |
